# Eigenvectors of a Hermitian Matrix

In this simple program, I coded the method to finding eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix that I saw int this article. ***Is not Ready yet!!!*** 

If you read the cited article, you can see that they can easily relate the squared module (and therefore, the real value) of eigenvectors components. At now my program can only calculate the **component module**, so I do not know yet how to discover their signal . Another probably issue is the rounding rules of SciPy routines, leading to errors like NaN when we calculate the saquare root of a value aproximated to zero.
